# NPO Mentorship Platform

Welcome to the Mentorship Platform, a progressive web-app developed for a non-profit organization committed to assisting talented young individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds in their journey to top international universities. This platform includes an alogrithm to identify the best mentors for each mentee and is designed to facilitate the user journey for mentors and mentees before and after starting their mentoring journey. 

The Mentorship Platform offers an array of features to facilitate mentorship and support for both mentors and mentees. The platform includes dedicated pages for mentors and mentees, allowing them to create profiles, provide matching information, and overview their mentorship engagements.
